# Dirty COW Exploit

## About

This project contains an implementation of the [Dirty COW exploit](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~arnold/427/18s/427_18S/indepth/dirty-cow/index.html). There are also examples of how the exploit can be used, which are designed to run on a 32-bit image of Ubuntu 14.04. The ISO used to develop these can be found [here](http://old-releases.ubuntu.com/releases/14.04.0/ubuntu-14.04.1-desktop-i386.iso).
